            <div class="intro">Although many women wear the traditional hijab or abaya, expats aren't expected to follow this custom. But it's still important to dress modestly and cover your shoulders and legs when you're out in public. </div>

            <div class="intro">Islam is the official religion of the UAE and plays a big part in how Emiratis live their everyday life. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward foreigners and allows them to practice their own religion. By the same token, non-Muslims are expected to respect the religious customs of the country. </div>

            <div class="intro">Arabian hospitality is the stuff of legends. In Abu Dhabi, it’s a lifestyle. Here, the warmth of welcome and generosity that emerged from encountering travellers in the desert generations ago, is very much a part of life today – from the traditional serving of Arabic coffee to an absolute dedication to the highest standards of modern service. </div>

            <div class="intro">Ramadan is the holiest time of the year in the Islamic calendar - and you should avoid eating, drinking and smoking in public or in front of Muslim friends and colleagues during fasting hours. At sunset, expats are encouraged to join in the breaking of the fast. Many companies operate on reduced hours and provide special rooms where non-Muslim employees can eat during the holy month.</div>

            <div class="intro">This is a spectacular sport and a trip to the races can be one of the most memorable highlights of a visit to Abu Dhabi. Cheer on the camels as they gallop around a specially made track, and marvel at how these seemingly ungainly creatures can reach such high speeds. Races normally take place on weekend mornings, with additional races on public holidays. </div>
